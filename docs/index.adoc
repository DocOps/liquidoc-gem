.A Note on Styles, Conventions, and Frameworks
****
This guide consists of “generic” LiquiDoc resources and instructions.
It presents a relatively “unopinionated”, or even inconsistently opinionated, application style.

As with any complex tool, conventions for file structures, namespaces, and orders of operation are highly recommended.
Because LiquiDoc is designed to adapt to existing AsciiDoc codebases, it is also highly configurable to match various environments.
Its main upstream dependencies -- Jekyll and Asciidoctor -- are similarly “configuration agnostic”.

You may *develop your own* conventions or *adopt/modify an approach* such as LiquiDoc Content Management Framework (link:{ldcmf_url}[source] | link:{ldcmf_guides}[docs]) -- whichever you find more helpful.

In any case, the breadth of configuration and namespace options for LiquiDoc command-line arguments and configuration formatting is relatively well represented in this manual.
