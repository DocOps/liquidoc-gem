= Deploy Actions

Mainstream deployment platforms are better suited to tying all your operations together, but we plan to bake a few common operations in to help you get started.
For true build-and-deployment control, consider build tools such as Make, Rake, and Gradle, or deployment tools like Travis CI, CircleCI, and Jenkins.

== Jekyll Serve

For testing purposes, however, spinning up a local webserver with the same stroke that you build a site is pretty rewarding and time saving, so we'll start there.

For now, this functionality is limited to adding a `--deploy` flag to your `liquidoc` command.
This will attempt to serve files from the `destination:` set for the associated Jekyll build.

[WARNING]
LiquiDoc-automated deployment of Jekyll sites is both limited and untested under nonstandard conditions.
Non-local deployment should be handled by external
continuous-integration/devlopment (CICD) tools.
