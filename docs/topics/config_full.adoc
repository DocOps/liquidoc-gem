= Configuring a LiquiDoc Build

Like any software or documentation build tool, routine configuration is key.
Everything needs to be just so in a build.
Order matters, and resources must be used wisely.

Rather than discuss build strategies broadly here, I have opted to move all my recommendations to the LiquiDoc Content Management Framework.
link:https://github.com/DocOps/liquidoc-cmf[LiquiDoc CMF's bootstrap repository] has more, but the link:https://www.ajyl.org/liquidoc-cmf-guides[LiquiDoc CMF Guides] are the real authority.
For now, look there for LDCMF-specific as well as broader strategic build insights.
